# Exercise 1 - Extracting data using `cut` command

The filter command `cut` helps us extract selected characters or fields from a line of text.

**1.1 Extracting characters.**

The command below shows how to extract the first four characters.

1.  1

1.  `echo "database" | cut -c1-4`

Copied!

You should get the string ‘data’ as output.

The command below shows how to extract 5th to 8th characters.

1.  1

1.  `echo "database" | cut -c5-8`

Copied!

You should get the string ‘base’ as output.

Non-contiguous characters can be extracted using the comma.

The command below shows how to extract the 1st and 5th characters.

1.  1

1.  `echo "database" | cut -c1,5`

Copied!

You get the output : ‘db’

**1.2. Extracting fields/columns**

We can extract a specific column/field from a delimited text file, by mentioning

-   the delimiter using the `-d` option, or
-   the field number using the `-f` option.

The /etc/passwd is a “:” delimited file.

The command below extracts user names (the first field) from /etc/passwd.

1.  1

1.  `cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd` 

Copied!

The command below extracts multiple fields 1st, 3rd, and 6th (username, userid, and home directory) from /etc/passwd.

1.  1

1.  `cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd` 

Copied!

The command below extracts a range of fields 3rd to 6th (userid, groupid, user description and home directory) from /etc/passwd.

1.  1

1.  `cut -d":" -f3-6 /etc/passwd`


# Exercise 2 - Transforming data using `tr`.

`tr` is a filter command used to translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters.

**2.1. Translate from one character set to another**

The command below translates all lower case alphabets to upper case.

1.  1

1.  `echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"` 

Copied!

You could also use the pre-defined character sets also for this purpose:

1.  1

1.  `echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]"` 

Copied!

The command below translates all upper case alphabets to lower case.

1.  1

1.  `echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"` 

Copied!

**2.2. Squeeze repeating occurrences of characters**

The **\-s** option replaces a sequence of a repeated characters with a single occurrence of that character.

The command below replaces repeat occurrences of ‘space’ in the output of `ps` command with one ‘space’.

1.  1

1.  `ps | tr -s " "`

Copied!

In the above example, the space character within quotes can be replaced with the following : `"[![:space:](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/graphics/emojis/space.png ":space:")]"`.

**2.3. Delete characters**

We can delete specified characters using the `-d`  option.

The command below deletes all digits.

1.  1

1.  `echo "My login pin is 5634" | tr -d "[:digit:]"`

Copied!

The output will be : ‘My login pin is’


# Exercise 3 - Start the PostgreSQL database.

On the terminal run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database.

1.  1

1.  `start_postgres`

Copied!

Note down the access information presented towards the end of these messages, especially the **CommandLine:**.

A sample commandline displayed looks as given below.   

1.  1

1.  `` `psql --username=postgres --host=localhost` ``

Copied!

Running this command from the shell prompt will start the interactive `psql` client which connects to the PostgreSQL server.


# Exercise 4 - Create a table

In this exercise we will create a table called ‘**users**‘ in the PostgreSQL database. This table will hold the user account information.

The table ‘users’ will have the following columns:

1.  uname
2.  uid
3.  home

Step 1: Connect to the database server

Use the connection string saved in the previous exercise to connect to the PostgreSQL server.

Run the command below to login to PostgreSQL server.

1.  1

1.  `psql --username=postgres --host=localhost`

Copied!

You will get the psql prompt: ‘postgres=#’

Step 2: Connect to a database.

We will use a database called **template1** which is already available by default.

To connect to this database, run the following command at the ‘postgres=#’ prompt.

```
1.  `\c template1`
```
Copied!

You will get the following message.

`You are now connected to database "template1" as user "postgres".`

Also, your prompt will change to ‘template1=#’.

Step 3: Create the table

Run the following statement at the ‘template1=#’ prompt:

1.  1

1.  `create table users(username varchar(50),userid int,homedirectory varchar(100));`

Copied!

If the table is created successfully, you will get the message below.

`CREATE TABLE`

Step 4: Quit the psql client

To exit the psql client and come back to the Linux shell, run the following command:
```
1.  `\q`
```

# Exercise 5 - Loading data into a PostgreSQL table.

In this exercise, we will create a shell script which does the following.

-   Extract the user name, user id, and home directory path of each user account defined in the /etc/passwd file.
-   Save the data into a comma separated (CSV) format.
-   Load the data in the csv file into a table in PostgreSQL database.

**5.1. Create a shell script**

Step 1: On the menu on the lab screen, use **File->New File** to create a new file.

![Screenshot highlighting New file in File dropdown menu](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/ETL%20using%20shell%20scripting/images/file_new.png)

Step 2: Give the name as ‘csv2db.sh’ and click ‘OK’.

![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Bash%20Scripting/ETL%20using%20shell%20scripting/images/file_name.png)

Step 3: State the objective of the script using comments.

Copy and paste the following lines into the newly created file.

1.  1
2.  2
3.  3
4.  4
5.  5
6.  6
7.  7
8.  8

1.  `# This script`
2.  `# Extracts data from /etc/passwd file into a CSV file.`

4.  `# The csv data file contains the user name, user id and` 
5.  `# home directory of each user account defined in /etc/passwd`

7.  `# Transforms the text delimiter from ":" to ",".`
8.  `# Loads the data from the CSV file into a table in PostgreSQL database.`

Copied!

Step 4: Save the file using the **File->Save** menu option.

**5.2. Extract required user information from /etc/passwd**

In this step, we will extract user name (field 1), user id (field 3), and home directory path (field 6) from /etc/passwd file using the `cut` command.

The /etc/passwd has “:” symbol as the column separator.

Copy the following lines and add them to the end of the script.

1.  1
2.  2
3.  3
4.  4
5.  5
6.  6
7.  7
8.  8

1.  `# Extract phase`

3.  `echo "Extracting data"`

5.  `# Extract the columns 1 (user name), 2 (user id) and` 
6.  `# 6 (home directory path) from /etc/passwd`

8.  `cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd` 

Copied!

Save the file.

Run the script.

1.  1

1.  `bash csv2db.sh`

Copied!

Verify that the output contains the three fields, that we extracted.

**5.3. Redirect the extracted output into a file.**

In this step, we will redirect the extracted data into a file named `extracted-data.txt`

_Replace_ the cut command at end of the script with the following command.

1.  1

1.  `cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd > extracted-data.txt`

Copied!

Save the file.

Run the script.

1.  1

1.  `bash csv2db.sh`

Copied!

Run the command below to verify that the file `extracted-data.txt` is created, and has the content.

1.  1

1.  `cat extracted-data.txt`

Copied!

**5.4. Transform the data into CSV format**

The extracted columns are separated by the original “:” delimiter.

We need to convert this into a “,” delimited file.

Add the below lines at the end of the script

1.  1
2.  2
3.  3
4.  4
5.  5

1.  `# Transform phase`
2.  `echo "Transforming data"`
3.  `# read the extracted data and replace the colons with commas.`

5.  `tr ":" "," < extracted-data.txt`

Copied!

Save the file.

Run the script.

1.  1

1.  `bash csv2db.sh`

Copied!

Verify that the output contains ‘,’ in place of “:”.

_Replace_ the tr command at end of the script with the command below.

1.  1

1.  `tr ":" "," < extracted-data.txt > transformed-data.csv`

Copied!

Save the file.

Run the script.

1.  1

1.  `bash csv2db.sh`

Copied!

Run the command below to verify that the file `transformed-data.csv` is created, and has the content.

1.  1

1.  `cat transformed-data.csv`

Copied!

**5.5. Load the data into the table ‘users’ in PostgreSQL**

To load data from a shell script, we will use the `psql` client utility in a non-interactive manner.

This is done by sending the database commands through a command pipeline to `psql` with the help of `echo` command.

Step 1: Add the copy command

PostgreSQL command to copy data from a CSV file to a table is `COPY`.

The basic structure of the command which we will use in our script is,

1.  1

1.  `COPY table_name FROM 'filename' DELIMITERS 'delimiter_character' FORMAT;`

Copied!

Now, add the lines below to the end of the script ‘csv2db.sh’.

1.  1
2.  2
3.  3
4.  4
5.  5
6.  6
```
1 `# Load phase`
2 `echo "Loading data"`
3 `# Send the instructions to connect to 'template1' and`
4 `# copy the file to the table 'users' through command pipeline.`

6.  `echo "\c template1;\COPY users  FROM '/home/project/transformed-data.csv' DELIMITERS ',' CSV;" | psql --username=postgres --host=localhost`
```
Copied!

Save the file.
